        description: "This is a 5 axis 650mm tall robotic arm, meant for educational purposes; through the build process, you will learn how a robotic arm is made, how it functions, and how to program it, with an illustrated guide that will drive you through every step. \n You can find a better description of it in the document at the link, as well as a complete list of all the electronic components, mechanical components, and 3D printed components. You will also find an illustrated procedure for the build, the schematic of the motherboard, the Gerber files for the PCB, and example code for Arduino. At the end of the document, there is also a cost estimate of the whole project. The document is both in English and in Italian.",
